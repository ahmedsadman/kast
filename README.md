# Kast

https://mykast.netlify.app

Create movie watch party with friends using locally downloaded multimedia files. All playback events are synced across participants. To make this work, all participants have to have the same media file downloaded in their devices. Kast is only responsible for playback sync and chatting

## Features
- Use local media files (movies/series etc) to create a watch party
- Chat with participants in real time
- Sync play, pause and timeline seek events so everyone is always on the same page
- Reactions (coming soon!)
